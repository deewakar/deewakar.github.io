* The "use strict" directive

** The directive "use strict" or 'use strict' (which is a string) is usually written at the top of the script to enable strict mode in javascript code.

#+begin_src javascript
  "use strict";
#+end_src

** Strict mode javascript code is not backwards compatible as it prevents certain old features of javascript and throws more exceptions.

** It can also be applied to a specific function only by enclosing inside the function body.

** Inside native ES modules and ES6 classes, strict mode is always enabled implicitly and cannot be disabled.
